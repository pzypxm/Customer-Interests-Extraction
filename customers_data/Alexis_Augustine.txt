Because I heart emoticon me some ‪#‎WutangClan‬...
I received a beautiful painting by the lovely, beautiful and talented Anna Agosa on my birthday. Let me give you a glimpse of who Anna is and how I met her........
I have known Anna aka Kchi Oodenakwe since I first started my company Enspired Visions in 2007 and she was one of the 25 girls that I picked from MySpace to help me grow my company. I sent her a package with a pair of my earrings and a letter that let her know exactly what my mission and purpose was with the creation of my company and that I needed help from fellow liked minded girls like her. I choose her because she was a leader in her own right who has such an open heart and who knows exactly who she is and does not follow the majority. Over the years I have seen her blossom into a exceptionally savvy Mother who teachers her daughter how to navigate this world by her own self determination and with the help of loved ones who believed in her. She is one of thee best writers that I know and if she chose to write for a living she would flourish because her writing leaves you wanting more because she brings you into a world you don't want to leave but rather have some tea and sit down and relax for a while. As an artist she has grown her skills to a high art that the most distinguished art galleries would be proud to display her work in because you can feel the emotion within the paintings she creates. She will continue to grow and she will create a path all her own painted with the colors of her life. It's going to be Beautiful......
Me and my beautiful friend Sandra Nakamura.

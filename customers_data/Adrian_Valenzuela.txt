I never thought i would say this but im done. I always thought the day will come were i will be doing something good but that never happened, people took my ideas people made money from my work, people stole my creations and people took advantage of my work. For those who support me, thank you so much but im done. And for those who are a piece of shit. Go f $&&!÷ your self.

The gentlemans card Elliott Terral
Im at a starbucks working on my computer and this lady approaches me with her new born baby and ask me if i can buy her some formula for her baby and right away i tell her "wait here" " i will be right back" when i came back i gave her the formula and she gave the biggest smile of happiness and she left telling me "god bless you". Im not trying to get a "great job" or anything im posting this because before she came to me she asked probably 10 people siting down with there ipods, laptops tablets etc. And all of them said "NO" to her. Who tha fuck does that shit to a baby! To a mother in need! Fucking world is so fucking disgusting!
Happy birthday to the great Brad Christian
